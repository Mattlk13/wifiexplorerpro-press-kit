## What is WiFi Explorer Pro?

WiFi Explorer Pro is a tool that allows you to scan, monitor and troubleshoot wireless networks. It offers a collection of views and filter controls that let you visualize and analyze the Wi-Fi environment in a simple manner.

You can use WiFi Explorer Pro to help design and validate wireless networks installations, as well as to identify channel conflicts, poor signal quality, non-802.11 interference and other issues that may be affecting the connectivity or performance of your home, office or enterprise wireless network.
